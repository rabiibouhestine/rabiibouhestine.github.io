    title: "Hey There! Let me tell you about myself!"
    excerpt: 'From a young age, I have loved numbers and knew that I wanted to make a career with them. 
    I love the world of computer science but wanted to be able to work closely with people and solving 
    everyday problems instead of just sitting in front of a screen all day. Becoming a data analyst gives 
    me the chance to work with math and actually use it to find positive solutions.<br>
    I would say that as a data analyst, I’m detail-oriented and accepting of the unknown. 
    I am driven by my curiosity and love exploring, this helped me go through a lot of challenges 
    and reveal well hidden answers within otherwise complicated data. I’m also a lifelong learner, 
    always seeking out the latest Data Analytics tools and techniques. I frequently make suggestions 
    to management about improvements and changes as my motivation comes from making a meaningful contribution. '
