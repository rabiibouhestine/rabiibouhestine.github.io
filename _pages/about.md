From a young age, I have loved numbers and knew that I wanted to make a career with them. I love the world of computer science but wanted to be able to work closely with people and solving everyday problems instead of just sitting in front of a screen all day. Becoming a data analyst gives me the chance to work with math and actually use it to find positive solutions.

I would say that as a data analyst, I’m detail-oriented and accepting of the unknown. I am driven by my curiosity and love exploring, this helped me go through a lot of challenges and reveal well hidden answers within otherwise complicated data. I’m also a lifelong learner, always seeking out the latest Data Analytics tools and techniques. I frequently make suggestions to management about improvements and changes as my motivation comes from making a meaningful contribution.
